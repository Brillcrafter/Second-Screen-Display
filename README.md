# Second Screen Display

This Plugin allows you to move any HudLcd items displayed on your screen into a separate window you can do whatever with.

To create the window use the command "/ssd open" and you can close it at any time.

If you have any issues, please reach out to me. My Discord handle is brillcrafter
